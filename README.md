YM-file parser
--------------

This [format] was designed by [Leonard/OXYGENE] for his AY-emulator [StSound].

YM-files are distributed as compressed [LHA] archives.

This library can help uncompress, parse the YM-files, and produce the AY/YM register changes for the players.

The YM music files can be downloaded from [here](https://bulba.untergrund.net/main_e.htm).
